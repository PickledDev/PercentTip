                by
                the app are the values for the sales tax and the percent sliders. This information is stored on the
                device
                in UserDefaults and is deleted when the app is deleted. UserDefaults is iOS's built in storage for app
                settings specific to the app.

            <p class="privacy">
                The PercentTip iOS Application does not have any age restrictions for its use as it is a simple tip
                calculator. The app itself does not collect and store information on external servers. The only
                information stored by the app are the values for the sales tax and the percent sliders. This
                information is stored on the device in UserDefaults and is deleted when the app is deleted.
                UserDefaults is iOS's built in storage for app settings specific to the app.

                On the side chance that someone under the age of 18 should contact the
                <strong>pickleddev@gmail.com</strong>
                email address, and I am unaware they under the age of 18, my communications would still be for changes
                or bug fixes for the application only, and only for the duration of that change/fix.

            <p class="privacy">
                Should it become aparent that communications are with a child, I will inform the child that they need a
                Parent or guardian to contact me, and no further communications will be responded to. Any future emails
                will be deleted.
