        <h1>PercentTip Privacy Policy</h1>

        <h3>Michael Irwin (Pickled Development) created PercentTip application as a <strong>Free</strong> app.</h3>
        <h3>This Service is provided by Michael Irwin (Pickled Development) at no cost and is intended for use as is.</h3>

        <hr>
        <p>
            This page is to inform visitors regarding, the policies for PercentTip, with the use, collection, and discloser of
            Personal Information.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you choose to use the PercentTip application, then you are agreeing to the collection and use of information in
            relation to this policy.  The information that I may collect is used for providing and improving the PercentTip
            application (see below).
        </p>

        <h3>Information Collection and Use</h3>
        <p>
            I may require you to provide an email, that may or may not contain your real name.  This email addresses will be used
            strictly for the use of communicating between you and Pickled Development.  I may request what apple device you are
            using, what iOS version you are on, and possibly a screen shot.
        </p>
        <p>
            Any information you send will be sent to the <strong>pickleddev@gmail.com</strong> email address.  I will use any
            provided information to improve or correct errors within the application, or communicate through this email address
            for the purposes of bug collection/resolution only.
        </p>
        <p>
            The app itself does not collect and store information on external servers.  The only information stored by the app
            are the values for the sales tax and the percent sliders.  This information is stored on the device in UserDefaults and
            is deleted when the app is deleted.  UserDefaults is iOS's built in storage for app settings specific to the app.
        </p>

        <h3>Cookies</h3>
        <p>
            I do not use or store any cookies for the use of the PercentTip iOS application.
        </p>
        <p>
            While visiting my <a href="">main page on GitHub</a>, GitHub may store cookies about you.  I do not store any of that
            information, and I do not collect it.
        </p>

        <h3>Service Providers</h3>
        <p>
            The PercentTip iOS application does not use any built in service providers nor does it use any 3rd party providers.
        </p>

        <h3>Security</h3>
        <p>
            I value your trust when providing any Personal Information to me; and I would hope you would do the same.  Please realize,
            no matter the method, when transmitting data over the internet it is never 100% secure or reliable.  Unfortunately, I
            cannot guarantee its security in transit.
        </p>

        <h3>Links to Other Sites</h3>
        <p>
            The PercentTip application does not contain any links to any web pages.
        </p>
        <p>
            While visiting my <a href="">main page on GitHub</a>, there may be external links to other sites.  I do not own or operate
            any of those sites.  Therefore, you should review any Privacy Policies when visiting those sites.
        </p>

        <h3>Children's Privacy</h3>
        <p>
            The PercentTip iOS Application does not have any age restrictions for its use as it is a simple tip calculator. The app
            itself does not collect and store information on external servers.  The only information stored by the app are the
            values for the sales tax and the percent sliders.  This information is stored on the device in UserDefaults and
            is deleted when the app is deleted.  UserDefaults is iOS's built in storage for app settings specific to the app.
        </p>
        <p>
            On the side chance that someone under the age of 18 should contact the <strong>pickleddev@gmail.com</strong> email address,
            and I am unaware they under the age of 18, my communications would still be for changes or bug fixes for the application
            only, and only for the duration of that change/fix.
        </p>
        <p>
            Should it become aparent that communications are with a child, I will inform the child that they need a Parent or
            guardian to contact me, and no further communications will be responded to.  Any future emails will be deleted.
        </p>

        <h3>Changes to this policy</h3>
        <p>
            I may update this policy page from time to time.  You should periodically review this page for any changes.  It is possible
            the change will go into effect if the PercentTip application is updated; in which case, I will provide information about
            changes to the policy in the application's description page.
        </p>
