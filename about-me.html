          <h3>Design & Development</h3>
          <p>
            I started learning to use computers and to code when I was 15 years
            old on a TRS80 Model I. The TRS80 was the first computer I had ever
            seen. My friend, Paul, and I played a game called Empire. Paul
            showed me the Basic language behind game and how to change it. At
            that moment, I was hooked, and wanted to learn as much about
            computers as I could.
          </p>
          <p>
            Since 2005, I have been programming professionally. I started with
            Visual Basic and worked myself up to using Go, Swift, and HTML.
            Along the way, I also learned how to work with Microsft SQL Server
            Reporting Services, Microsoft SQL Datbases and PostGre databases,
            and finally started learning Swift so I could create applications
            for iOS devices.

          <h3>PC Experience</h3>
          <p>
            I started building computers around 1992. I built my first IBM
            Clone, a 386dx computer with a whopping 4MB of RAM From there, I
            built my own machines about every year or two to keep up with
            technology.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have worked 14 years in call centers, like Compaq, supporting
            customer's computers, laptops, and servers before focusing more on
            application development.
