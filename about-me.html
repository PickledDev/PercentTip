        <h3>Design & Development</h3>
        <p>
          I started learning to use computers and to code when I was 15 years old on a TRS80 Model I. The TRS80 was the
          first computer I had ever seen. My friend, Paul, and I played a game called Empire. Paul showed me the Basic
          language behind game and how to change it. At that moment, I was hooked, and wanted to learn as much about
          computers as I could.
        </p>
        <p>
          Since 2005, I have been programming professionally. I started with Visual Basic and worked myself up to using
          Go, Swift, and HTML. Along the way, I also learned how to work with Microsft SQL Server Reporting Services,
          Microsoft SQL Datbases and PostGre databases, and finally started learning Swift so I could create applications
          for iOS devices.

        <h3>PC Experience</h3>
        <p>
          I started building computers around 1992. I built my first IBM Clone, a 386dx computer with a whopping 4MB of RAM
          From there, I built my own machines about every year or two to keep up with technology.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have worked 14 years in call centers, like Compaq, supporting customer's computers, laptops, and servers before
          focusing more on application development.
